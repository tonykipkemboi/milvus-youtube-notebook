# Zilliz Vector Database YouTube Transcripts Analyzer ðŸš€

This project utilizes the YouTube API and [Milvus](https://milvus.io/), an open-source, highly performant vector database, to fetch, analyze, and search through transcripts of YouTube videos from any given channel's playlist. The analysis is performed using a HuggingFace Transformer model to embed the transcripts into vector space, which is then inserted into Milvus for similarity searching.
